# Presentation of the Two-Dimensional Affect and Feeling Space - 2DAFS (Lorette, 2021)
The 2DAFS is a useful, innovative and user-friendly instrument that allows for the collection of both continuous valence and arousal ratings and categorical emotion perception data in a quick and flexible way.
You are welcome to use this instrument for research purposes (see https://github.com/PernelleL/2DAFS/blob/main/p5_2021.js) as long as you cite it appropriately (see below)

The software implementing this interactive response format has been developed by Samuel Lorette with p5.js, a JavaScript library which is based on the principles of the programming language Processing. It can be integrated in online surveys. Three versions are available: in English, in Simplified Chinese, and in Traditional Chinese. 

An example of an integration into a Limesurvey can be found here: http://survey2.sl-services.be/index.php/521811?lang=en
