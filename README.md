# Presentation of the Two-Dimensional Affect and Feeling Space - 2DAFS (Lorette, 2021)
The 2DAFS is a useful, innovative and user-friendly instrument that allows for the collection of both continuous valence and arousal ratings and categorical emotion perception data in a quick and flexible way.
You are welcome to use this instrument for research purposes (see https://github.com/PernelleL/2DAFS/blob/main/p5_2021.js) as long as you cite it appropriately (see below)

The software implementing this interactive response format has been developed by Samuel Lorette with p5.js, a JavaScript library which is based on the principles of the programming language Processing. It can be integrated in online surveys. Three versions are available o far: in English, in Simplified Chinese, and in Traditional Chinese. A shorter Spanish version is also available upon request (with less emotion labels available in the second phase).
Researchers are allowed to adapt the tool, for instance if they wish to rename some emotion labels in phase 2 or if they wish to delete or add some).

An example of an integration into a Limesurvey can be found here: http://survey2.sl-services.be/index.php/521811?lang=en (The question group used in this example can be found as a .lsg file in this github repository and can be directly imported in a LimeSurvey questionnaire.) The zip-file "Theme_for_2DAFS.zip" containing a specific has to be imported in Limesurvey for the question group "limesurvey-"DAFS_demo_QuestionGroup.lsg" to work properly.
